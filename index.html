        <h4>Who am I?</h4>
        <p>I, Sir Swampy am someone who enjoys frequent debates and discussions about all things tech. I have views about companies like Intel/AMD/Nvidia that nobody likes to hear. My main one being none of which want to make the best for "budget" gamers, they want what is best for their profit. Meaning they take advantage of the budget gamers in order to make the most money. Look at Amd x3d, that isn't an attempt to make budget gamers feel warm, <strong> it's a working practice that takes advantage of them. <strong>  </p>
